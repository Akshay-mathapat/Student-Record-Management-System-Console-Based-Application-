# Student-Record-Management-System-Console-Based-Application-
📘 Student Record Management System (Console-Based Application)  The Student Record Management System is a menu-driven Python application designed to manage student academic records efficiently using basic data structures and control flow concepts.
This project allows users to add, view, search, update, and analyze student data directly from the console. Each student record is stored as a dictionary, and all records are maintained in a list, demonstrating practical use of lists, dictionaries, loops, functions, and conditional statements.
